  <p><b>Age Eleven — Part 2</b></p>

  <p>Five days had passed since I holed up in my room.</p>

  <p>I overshot my plan by two days, but I finally completed the foundation of the spell I’d been working on.
  My head pounded from lack of sleep, but the thrill of achievement blew the pain away in an instant.</p>

  <p>Then, just as suddenly, all strength drained from my body and I collapsed on the spot.
  Weird—my legs wouldn’t move. I couldn’t stand.
  Must’ve been the sleep deprivation, mana overuse, and lopsided diet.</p>

  <p>I picked up my little wooden wand from the floor and pointed it at the Otem in the corner.</p>

  <p><i>“……পুতুল……人形よ　দখল踊れ”</i></p>

  <p>The Otem stirred at my chant and dragged itself over to me.
  I released the wand, braced myself with the Otem’s top, and forced myself upright, then reached for a small vial on the desk.</p>

  <p>Inside was my homemade energy drink.
  I’d recently named it “Abel Potion.”</p>

  <p>I crawled back to the floor, bit the cap off, and chugged it.
  Strength seeped back into my limbs. I could still move—barely.</p>

  <p>I stood with the help of the Abel Potion.
  My hands and legs wouldn’t stop shaking, but that happens when I push too hard.
  I clenched my elbows and knees hard for five minutes; the tremor eased.</p>

  <p>For now, I’d celebrate finishing the spell—well, the foundation of it.
  From here it would be endless testing, fine-tuning, adding data, applications, optimizations… the works.</p>

  <p>But staying shut in any longer was dangerous.
  I had no idea what sort of face Father was making outside.</p>

  <p>And frankly, my body was about at its limit.
  Dying would render all this moot.
  My meals had been dried bread, Eve fruit, and Abel Potions—no wonder my sense of taste had gone weird.
  Also… the world’s colors looked off. My sleep debt was reaching human-breaking levels.</p>

  <p>I’d dragged Giselle into this too.
  She’d at least been sleeping properly, so better off than me, but being boxed up with nothing to do had to be rough.
  She’d been eating the same rations as I was, too.
  …It was rough, right?
  Though her skin looked glossier than usual. Probably my imagination. Right?</p>

  <p>Anyway—time to tell her it worked.</p>

  <p><i>“Giselle, it’s done!”</i></p>

  <p>The instant I called, Giselle bolted upright from my bed and ran to the desk.</p>

  <p><i>“So the spell you’ve been wanting to make all this time is finally complete!”</i></p>

  <p>She flapped her hands, overjoyed as if it were her own success.</p>

  <p><i>“Yeah. I leaned on a lot of references… but this is still a spell I built myself.”</i></p>

  <p>I should report to the chief, too. I wanted his thoughts.</p>

  <p><i>“Amazing! I knew Brother would manage it someday! But… I didn’t really understand it from your explanation. Could you show me right away?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Of course. Watch closely.”</i></p>

  <p>I picked up the wand I’d just tossed and gave it a flourish.
  I wasn’t yet used to picturing this circle, so it took time.
  I assembled it in my head and slowly projected it.</p>

  <p><i>“আম我を　প্রকাশিত表せ”</i></p>

  <p>Once the circle was complete, I chanted.
  A small square plane flickered into existence before me.</p>

  <p>――――――――――</p>
  <p>『アベル・べレーク』<br>
  STR（筋力）:2<br>
  MAG（魔力）:865</p>
  <p>――――――――――</p>

  <p><i>“This… it has your name on it, Brother. What is it?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“A status display. It was a pain—formatting, the glyphs, everything has to be encoded into the circle.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Sta… tus? Then this is…?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Right. With this spell I can check a target’s muscle strength and mana. Eventually I want race to show up, add more fields, maybe even attach a brief description.”</i></p>

  <p>In another-world stories, status screens are a staple.
  If it doesn’t exist, you make it.
  Hard to believe it’s been nearly ten years since I was disappointed not to have one.</p>

  <p>As for the numbers: for both fields, 20 is the average for an adult Maren.
  All those years of carving Otems showed up in my mana value.</p>

  <p>…That part was gratifying, but I hadn’t expected my strength to be so pathetic.
  Even as the spell’s creator, I wanted to believe it was an error.
  Then again, I was only eleven—maybe this was normal.
  Maybe Father was right; I should help with the hunt again for a while.</p>

  <p><i>“I can’t believe you made something like this…”</i></p>

  <p><i>“There’s a spell that assesses mana strength by color—this grew out of that idea.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Do mine next! Please!”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Okay. Don’t move.”</i></p>

  <p>I aimed the wand at Giselle and floated another circle.
  …This array was too detailed—projection was tricky.</p>

  <p>If I wanted to increase the information displayed, it would only get more complex.
  I needed a way to shorten it.
  A quick, simplified version that just shows STR and MAG might be worth making.
  Plenty of room for improvement.</p>

  <p>――――――――――</p>
  <p>『ジゼル・べレーク』<br>
  STR（筋力）:8<br>
  MAG（魔力）:37</p>
  <p>――――――――――</p>

  <p>Giselle’s mana wasn’t at my level, but it was high—
  again, with 20 as an adult average.</p>

  <p>A bit of exposure to magic from early childhood clearly mattered.
  Father said he didn’t start working with circles until he was past twenty.
  The Maren really should mandate rigorous magical training from a young age.
  Then we could build an army of arch-magi and take over the wor—huh?</p>

  <p>Wait. Giselle’s strength… higher than mine…?</p>

  <p><i>“Brother’s mana really is amazing!”</i></p>

  <p>Her voice rose—less from excitement than from trying to cover something up.
  She’d noticed her STR beat mine and was being considerate.
  That hurt more than the number.</p>

  <p><i>“…Still, with adult Maren averaging 20, yours is plenty high too, Giselle.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Average Maren… 20…”</i></p>

  <p>Her face clouded, and she murmured it.
  Don’t look at me like that.
  She noticed my glance and quickly fixed her expression. That kindness stung again.</p>

  <p><i>“It must be thanks to copying Brother’s training, even just a little!”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Y-yeah. Probably.”</i></p>

  <p>I flicked the wand and dismissed the display.</p>

  <p>I hadn’t expected to lose to my little sister by a factor of four in STR.
  That one hit hard. Really hard.
  I was honestly shaken.</p>

  <p>Not that Giselle was some gorilla.
  She was probably just… average.</p>

  <p>I’d ducked Father’s hunting invitations with excuses and hiding.
  When told to farm, I made Otems do it.
  Otherwise I was shut in with research.</p>

  <p>Even Otem-carving requires little force—
  Maren carving knives use the wood’s latent mana to cut easily.</p>

  <p>Giselle lived similarly, but at least she accompanied Mother shopping, making her life slightly more normal.
  To put it mildly, I was the trash here.</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>When I finally came out, Father unloaded on me.</p>

  <p><i>“So you’ve finally slithered out, you idiot son! Do you hate hunting that much!?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Father! Brother was developing a spell! If you saw what he—”</i></p>

  <p><i>“That’s not the point!”</i></p>

  <p><i>“If you’re going to scold Brother, then scold me too! I was basically helping him!”</i></p>

  <p><i>“No need.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Why not!?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Because scolding Abel alone works better on you.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“G… that’s such a—”</i></p>

  <p>As expected, Father knew Giselle too well.</p>

  <p><i>“Giselle, it’s fine. This one’s entirely my fault. …Father, I apologize. I won’t let this happen again.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“…You’re being unusually honest. What are you plotting?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“B-Brother? What’s wrong? You never admit fault so easily about magic. That’s not like you. Are you getting sick again?”</i></p>

  <p>…Ouch.
  Is that really how you see me?</p>

  <p><i>“No. I finally understand the importance of hunting. Rather than having Otems hunt, I should train my own body. Starting tomorrow, I’ll go every day. I’m sorry for all the trouble.”</i></p>

  <p>Giselle’s face flickered with realization, then she hastily smoothed it over when our eyes met.</p>

  <p><i>“I think Brother is wonderful just the way you are!”</i></p>

  <p>…Thanks for the kindness.
  But as your big brother, I can’t accept that—from myself. If possible, don’t soften the blow.</p>

  <p>In the end, my declaration lasted all of three days.
  I caved to Giselle’s gentle concern, pampered my body again, and found myself arguing with Father through the door once more.</p>

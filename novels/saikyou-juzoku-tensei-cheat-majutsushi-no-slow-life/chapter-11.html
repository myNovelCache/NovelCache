  <p><b>Age Seven — Part 4</b></p>

  <p>The chief sat in a room surrounded by Otems, reading a thick book.</p>

  <p>His hair had lost its luster, and deep wrinkles marked his face — yet for someone said to be a hundred and fifty years old, he looked far too young.
  His large frame still seemed strong, not much muscle lost despite rarely leaving the mansion.
  For someone like me — who used any excuse to skip hunting with Father and devote myself to magic training — that kind of physical upkeep was impressive.</p>

  <p>The Maren weren’t particularly long-lived; the chief had simply used magic and sorcery to slow his aging.
  His muscle retention was likely part of that.
  Ordinarily, Maren lived around eighty years — not much different from humans in my previous world.
  Their civilization was underdeveloped, but simple magic could maintain health to some degree, so they aged more slowly.
  Still, there were diseases even magic couldn’t cure, and dangers from monsters or disasters.
  In truth, their average lifespan was far lower than Japan’s.</p>

  <p>The chief looked up from his book, adjusting his monocle and glaring at me.</p>

  <p><i>“…Philo, and… who might this be?”</i></p>

  <p>He squinted suspiciously. We’d only exchanged formal greetings during ceremonies, so of course he didn’t remember me — it had been about half a year since the last one.</p>

  <p><i>“My name is Abel Belek, and this is my sister, Giselle. I apologize for the sudden visit, but I have a request.”</i></p>

  <p>I bowed deeply. Giselle hurried to copy me.</p>

  <p><i>“Hmph, Zele’s boy. I’ve heard much from Philo. You and my granddaughter seem rather clo—”</i></p>

  <p><i>“G-Grandfather!”</i></p>

  <p>Philo’s shout cut him off. The chief frowned at her annoyance, narrowing his eyes until she flinched back half a step.</p>

  <p><i>“Well, fine,”</i> he said, changing the subject. <i>“So, Abel. What is this request?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Actually, I’ve reached a dead end in my training. I was hoping, if you had the time, that you could teach me magic.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Hmph. So the boy thinks I have that much free time.”</i></p>

  <p>He said it in a bitter tone, shaking his head slowly.</p>

  <p>Come on, you don’t have to interpret everything in the worst way…
  Maybe I already had a bad reputation. My strange habits probably spread through gossip — and I wouldn’t be surprised if Philo had twisted the story a few times herself.</p>

  <p><i>“Ha! So that’s what this is about?”</i> Philo said smugly. <i>“You wanted Grandfather to teach you? You barely even know him! That’s so shameless! I suppose I could learn from him first and then teach you, depending on your attitude… or your sincerity…”</i></p>

  <p>Who do you think you are?</p>

  <p>Still, maybe I’d rushed this. Philo’s mother had been so welcoming that I let my guard down, but I probably should’ve arranged a proper appointment first.
  I still hadn’t mastered Maren customs for this sort of thing.</p>

  <p><i>“Philo,”</i> said the chief.</p>

  <p><i>“Y-yes, Grandfather?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Leave us.”</i></p>

  <p>Philo almost toppled forward. She straightened and tried to protest.</p>

  <p><i>“B-but… what if Abel does something rude to you? And, um, Abel is… Abel is…”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Leave,”</i> he said flatly.</p>

  <p><i>“…Yes, sir.”</i></p>

  <p>Head bowed, Philo slunk out. She looked back a few times, but when the chief furrowed his brow, she hurried her pace.</p>

  <p>Well, she did make conversation impossible.
  Reasonable decision, really.
  So much for softening his attitude — she’d been completely useless for that.</p>

  <p><i>“Hmph… you want to learn magic from me, do you? I’m not so easily swayed by the whims of a boy.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Does that mean… no?”</i> I asked.</p>

  <p><i>“If you give up quickly, it’s a waste of time. I doubt you have much resolve. I’m an old man, and my remaining years are few.”</i></p>

  <p>Yikes. Hostile right off the bat.</p>

  <p>How was I supposed to respond to that?
  He brought up his age himself — I couldn’t exactly disagree, but I couldn’t agree either.
  Even if I said something polite, he’d probably twist it into sarcasm.</p>

  <p>Was he trying to trap me?
  No, calm down. I was just overthinking — his looks were intimidating, and his reputation didn’t help.</p>

  <p><i>“No, no,”</i> I said with a polite smile. <i>“The Chief still seems quite healthy and strong.”</i></p>

  <p>Perfect answer. I’d avoided any mention of age directly. Smooth.</p>

  <p>Or so I thought.</p>

  <p><i>“Hmph. So you’re only being considerate because I’m old.”</i></p>

  <p>You made me, old man!
  I swallowed the retort. What was that? I dodged perfectly, and he still found a way to complain!
  If I’d answered bluntly, he’d call me insolent; if I dodged, I was “being polite because he’s old.”
  What kind of answer was he expecting?</p>

  <p>I’d thought maybe sending Philo out meant he’d take me seriously, but… no.
  Maybe he’d just wanted to scold a child without his granddaughter watching.</p>

  <p>Maybe I really should look elsewhere for a teacher.</p>

  <p><i>“So… does that mean you refuse, Chief?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Hmph. You’re impatient. I never said no.”</i></p>

  <p>You totally did — your tone said everything!</p>

  <p><i>“Then… will you teach me?”</i> I asked carefully.</p>

  <p><i>“I never said yes either. Don’t rush me, boy.”</i></p>

  <p>What kind of back-and-forth was this?</p>

  <p><i>“…Very well,”</i> he said at last. <i>“Let’s see how serious you are. Come again tomorrow morning.”</i></p>

  <p>…Wasn’t that basically a yes?
  If I didn’t seem serious, he could just stop teaching me. This was effectively approval.</p>

  <p>I’d achieved my goal — I was to become the chief’s apprentice — but somehow, it didn’t feel satisfying at all.</p>

  <p>Still, I decided to take the win and head home for the day.
  Giselle and I walked together down the path from the chief’s house.</p>

  <p><i>“Um, brother…”</i> she said softly.</p>

  <p><i>“Maybe stubbornness runs in the chief’s family,”</i> I muttered.</p>

  <p><i>“Stubbornness?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Never mind.”</i></p>

  <p>Probably not a concept they had here.</p>

  <p>For the record, the so-called stubborn old tsundere chief began teaching me the very next day — as if nothing had happened.</p>

  <p>He was so well prepared that I couldn’t help wondering if… maybe, just maybe, he’d actually been hoping for a disciple all along.</p>

  <p><b>Age Seven — Part 2</b></p>

  <p>Giselle and I returned home and quietly went up to the second floor.</p>

  <p>If our parents found out that we’d taken the divination cards without permission, we’d be in serious trouble.</p>

  <p>After putting them back in their proper place, we went downstairs and waited for Father to return.</p>

  <p>Father was busy with hunting, pest control, and meetings with the village elders, so he usually didn’t come home until evening.</p>

  <p>While I watched Giselle stack wooden blocks, I bit into an Eeve fruit I’d picked earlier.</p>

  <p>Eeve trees grew on the outskirts of the settlement, and I’d gathered some on my way back from magic training.</p>

  <p>They were sweet and surprisingly tasty.
  Mother would scold me if she caught me eating before dinner, but surely she’d forgive me for just one piece.</p>

  <p>The Maren only ate twice a day — once in the morning and once in the evening.
  I still wasn’t used to that two-meal system.</p>

  <p><i>“Brother, I want one of those too.”</i></p>

  <p>Giselle stopped stacking her blocks and looked up at me.</p>

  <p><i>“No. You won’t be able to eat your dinner. I’ll save you one — you can have it after we eat.”</i></p>

  <p>She looked like she really wanted to argue, but finally gave a small nod.</p>

  <p><i>“…Okay.”</i></p>

  <p>Good. Obedient and reasonable.</p>

  <p>Then, the front door opened — Father was home.</p>

  <p>Perfect. Time to ask him about getting a teacher for magic.</p>

  <p>I stood up quickly and walked toward the entrance.
  Behind me, Giselle followed with her little steps.</p>

  <p><i>“Welcome home, Father.”</i><br>
  <i>“Welcome home, Father!”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Ah, Abel, Giselle — I’m sorry I’m late. Let’s have supper soon.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Father, there’s something I’d like to ask you first.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“What is it?”</i></p>

  <p>I opened my magic book to a particular page and held it out for him to see.</p>

  <p><i>“These two magic circles — the one for launching fireballs and the one for launching water spheres — their structures are very similar. What’s the exact difference in meaning between the parts that aren’t the same?”</i></p>

  <p>That wasn’t the question I really wanted answered.
  I just wanted to test how deep Father’s understanding of magic actually went.</p>

  <p><i>“Hmm…”</i> Father groaned, rubbing his forehead. <i>“I’d thought you were finally becoming more like a normal child lately. You’ve been calmer, spending more time outside, making fewer Otems… but you’re still practicing magic, aren’t you?”</i></p>

  <p>He sounded exasperated.</p>

  <p>Once, he used to be proud just to see me carving Otems.
  When had things changed so much?</p>

  <p>I suppose if I had a seven-year-old who spent every day studying, I’d be a little worried too.</p>

  <p><i>“So, what’s the difference?”</i> I pressed.</p>

  <p><i>“Abel, that book is still too early for you. It’s said that one begins using incantations and magic circles properly around the time of adulthood. Until then, you don’t need to be reading things like this.”</i></p>

  <p>He reached out for the book.</p>

  <p>I quickly pulled it back and held it against my chest.</p>

  <p><i>“Father, my brother can already use spells and magic cir— mmph!”</i></p>

  <p>I clamped my hand over Giselle’s mouth.</p>

  <p>That was close.</p>

  <p>Father probably discouraged my training because he thought my obsession with magic was unhealthy.
  If he found out I could already use spells and circles, his suspicion would only worsen.</p>

  <p><i>“I want to become a great magician someday,”</i> I said earnestly.</p>

  <p><i>“It’s all right,”</i> Father replied. <i>“At your age, to have carved so many Otems already — that’s more than enough talent. You don’t need to rush.”</i></p>

  <p>Ugh, frustrating.</p>

  <p>Looks like making him my teacher is out of the question.
  He was away too often for hunting anyway, and to be honest, I doubted his magic was much better than mine anymore.</p>

  <p><i>“Besides,”</i> he continued, <i>“you don’t need to understand the meaning of a magic circle. Only those called Sages, who possess vast knowledge, can analyze or modify one. Most magicians simply memorize the existing circles and use them as they are.”</i></p>

  <p>…I wanted to learn exactly that part, though.</p>

  <p>With my current knowledge, there was only so much I could do.
  It was like reading nothing but grade-school arithmetic books forever — I wanted a proper textbook on higher math.</p>

  <p><i>“Is there anyone in this village you’d call a Sage?”</i> I asked.</p>

  <p><i>“There is — only one. The chief. But even he says it’s better to use existing magic circles rather than making your own. They’re more stable and consume less magic power.”</i></p>

  <p>Of course. The chief.</p>

  <p>An intimidating old man.</p>

  <p>He claimed to be a hundred and fifty years old, though he looked closer to seventy.
  Apparently, he used magic to slow his aging.</p>

  <p>He was still physically strong too — always shouting at someone or another.</p>

  <p>The chief rarely left his mansion except for village meetings and rituals.
  But I’d heard rumors that about ten years ago, when a dangerous monster wandered near the village, he personally went into the forest with a few attendants and annihilated it in seconds.</p>

  <p>Yeah… if anyone in this village knew magic best, it would be him.</p>

  <p>The problem was his descendant — or great-great-granddaughter, I wasn’t exactly sure how many generations apart — a girl named Philo.</p>

  <p>I didn’t get along with her. Every time we met, she picked a fight.
  Between my training and looking after Giselle, I didn’t have time for her nonsense.</p>

  <p>Still… if the chief truly was that powerful, he’d have time — and books, lots of books.
  A century and a half of magical knowledge.
  He might be the perfect teacher.</p>

  <p>I decided I’d visit his mansion tomorrow.</p>

  <p><i>“Oh, I see… I thought magic could do a lot more,”</i> I said with a disappointed sigh.</p>

  <p><i>“Ah… well…”</i> Father faltered.</p>

  <p><i>“I mean, I thought you could just poof — make a meat pie appear or something.”</i></p>

  <p>I wiggled my fingers dramatically, then dropped my shoulders in fake despair.</p>

  <p><i>“Sigh… what’s the point of magic, then? Just to make rituals go smoothly? That’s all it’s good for, huh?”</i></p>

  <p>Father stared at me, wide-eyed and speechless.</p>

  <p>I might get scolded later for that, but whatever.</p>

  <p>Better to overact and remove suspicion entirely.</p>

  <p>One last push.</p>

  <p><i>“Oh, by the way, Father — you were about to take this earlier, right? Do you need it for something? Well, great, saves me the trouble of putting it away. I’m done with it. Didn’t understand a word anyway.”</i></p>

  <p>I shoved the book toward him.</p>

  <p>He blinked, then muttered, <i>“P-put it away yourself,”</i> and walked off toward the living room.</p>

  <p>Somehow, his back looked smaller than usual.</p>

  <p>Maybe he was disappointed — that his son, who’d once been so devoted to magic, suddenly seemed to give up on it.</p>

  <p>He was a difficult man to deal with.</p>

  <p>But that was fine.</p>

  <p>At least this way, he wouldn’t suspect a thing for a while.</p>

  <p><b>Age Seven — Part 1</b></p>

  <p>A full year had passed since I began training clairvoyance with the divination cards.</p>

  <p>I was now seven.<br>
  Giselle was five.</p>

  <p>When I focused on the back of a card and channeled my intent, the image on the front would now appear faintly in my mind’s eye.<br>
  I could guess every card correctly — one hundred percent accuracy.</p>

  <p>Apparently, even among adult Maren, few could reach that level.<br>
  I was glad I had trained from such a young age — perhaps I had a natural talent for it as well.</p>

  <p>Still, this ability worked only because the divination cards themselves held magical energy.<br>
  It wasn’t like I could see through walls or anything.<br>
  It was useful only as a training method, not for any real-world purpose.</p>

  <p>So no, I couldn’t use it to peek at people bathing or changing clothes.<br>
  There were spells and magic circles that supposedly allowed such sight, but I wasn’t capable of casting those yet.</p>

  <p><i>“প্রেত光よ　আঁকা描け”</i></p>

  <p>I recited from the magic book, raising my hand toward the air.</p>

  <p>This was spirit language — an incantation that called upon the spirits in the atmosphere to assist in manifesting magic.</p>

  <p>Complex spells, it seemed, required three components:<br>
  your own magic power as fuel, the spell (the words) to call spirits, and a magic circle to issue detailed commands to them.</p>

  <p>In short, pure magic power could only produce simple effects.<br>
  By adding an incantation, one could influence spirits and cause physical phenomena like fire,<br>
  and by adding a magic circle, that phenomenon could be freely shaped or controlled.</p>

  <p>There were exceptions, of course, but generally:</p>

  <p><b>Magic power = fuel or wage</b></p>
  <p><b>Incantation = verbal command</b></p>
  <p><b>Magic circle = blueprint</b></p>

  <p>The spell I was casting was one that drew shapes in the air — a practice spell for inscribing magic circles.<br>
  It allowed the spirits to trace the image in my mind into the air using gathered light.<br>
  Since it only involved manipulating light, it didn’t require a magic circle itself.</p>

  <p>Drawing with ink worked just as well, but once you got used to this, it was far faster —<br>
  though accuracy and speed depended heavily on the caster’s skill.</p>

  <p>Today’s exercise, however, wasn’t to draw a magic circle.<br>
  I was drawing Giselle’s face.</p>

  <p>After about ten minutes, the shimmering outline was complete — from the sheen of her cheeks to the soft texture of her hair, all recreated in glowing air.</p>

  <p>Success.</p>

  <p>Last time, her face had come out stretched sideways and fat, and she’d burst into tears.<br>
  Apparently, she didn’t mind being my Otem model, but she did mind being drawn plump.<br>
  Maybe it was worse because it still looked somewhat like her.</p>

  <p>Ah, the burdens of an older brother — having to balance training and entertaining your little sister.<br>
  Not that I really minded. It was fun.</p>

  <p><i>“It looks just like me!”</i></p>

  <p>Giselle clapped happily, laughing and spinning around.<br>
  I smiled in satisfaction, then cut off the magic.</p>

  <p>The glowing portrait dissolved into the air.</p>

  <p><i>“Ah…”</i></p>

  <p>She let out a small, sad sigh.</p>

  <p>Sorry, Giselle — maintaining the image eats up a lot of magic power.</p>

  <p>At least it was good practice.</p>

  <p>Simple figures could be drawn in ten seconds or less,<br>
  but even then, I couldn’t imagine this being practical for combat or daily use.</p>

  <p>Just firing one fireball took an absurd amount of preparation.</p>

  <p>First, a spell to draw the magic circle.<br>
  Then, another to ignite the flame.</p>

  <p><i>“প্রেত光よ　আঁকা描け”</i></p>

  <p>I spoke again, raising my right hand and focusing on the diagram in the book before me —<br>
  a magic circle for shaping and launching a contained fireball.</p>

  <p>It didn’t create fire itself, only formed a conduit for it.<br>
  To ignite the flame, another incantation was required.</p>

  <p>Spirits were terribly literal creatures.<br>
  They seemed to understand the incantations but lacked will or intellect — more like instinctive responses than true thought.</p>

  <p>According to my books, spirits were formed from the lingering thoughts of living beings,<br>
  mixed fragments of souls bound to the land or objects.<br>
  Everywhere in the world contained them, in varying densities.</p>

  <p><i>“শিখা炎よ　এই হাত球を象れ”</i></p>

  <p>I needed to keep the power low — I didn’t want to set the forest on fire.</p>

  <p>Flame gathered in my palm, forming a small sphere.<br>
  I launched it straight ahead.<br>
  It hit the ground, flared, then vanished with a brief crackle.</p>

  <p><i>“W-wow! Amazing!”</i></p>

  <p>This was the first time Giselle had seen me use actual fire magic.</p>

  <p>Up until now, I’d only practiced when I could be alone.<br>
  It was too risky — I didn’t want to hurt her.</p>

  <p>She squealed with joy, but I wasn’t satisfied.</p>

  <p><i>“Hmmm…”</i></p>

  <p>It took me nearly twenty seconds to perform the entire sequence.</p>

  <p>In my fantasy logic, that’s long enough for a goblin to beat me to death before the spell fires.<br>
  Kind of kills the dream when you think about it realistically.</p>

  <p>Honestly, a bow and arrow would be far more efficient.</p>

  <p>Even if I trained to cast faster, for something like hunting, arrows would do just fine.</p>

  <p>There had been wars in the distant past, but judging by this peaceful village, that age was long gone.<br>
  No one was firing spells at each other anymore.</p>

  <p>And if everyone could use magic anyway, it wasn’t even impressive — it was just… ordinary.</p>

  <p>Wait—<br>
  …Is that why nobody here takes magic that seriously?</p>

  <p>N-no, that can’t be it.<br>
  It’s magic, for crying out loud.</p>

  <p>I’ve devoted my entire childhood to this!</p>

  <p>…Better not overthink it.</p>

  <p>No — this will be useful somehow.<br>
  I’ve already come too far to stop.<br>
  I have to master magic.</p>

  <p>Still, the books at home could only take me so far.<br>
  The basics were fine, but I wanted to try more advanced techniques — things the texts didn’t fully explain.<br>
  I had too many questions only experience could answer.</p>

  <p>It was about time I found myself a teacher.</p>

  <p>Maybe I should ask Father.</p>

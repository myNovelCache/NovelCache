  <p><b>Age Four</b></p>

  <p>Another two years passed, and I turned four.</p>

  <p>By now, I was fully accustomed to life as a member of the Maren tribe.<br>
  I’d even grown to enjoy the white soup I once thought was just glorified water, and I could gulp down heated snake blood without flinching.<br>
  A pig’s head on the dinner table no longer fazed me in the slightest.</p>

  <p>I was long since used to my pale-skinned relatives and my own light-colored appearance, and my hobby had become crafting Otems.<br>
  Every morning, I stood before the sacred window to offer prayers.<br>
  At this point, going back to my old life might actually be harder than staying here.</p>

  <p>The longer I lived among the Maren, the more convinced I became that this world wasn’t Earth.</p>

  <p>I lowered my gaze from the sky to the log in my hands.<br>
  Today again, I sat in the yard beside our house, carving the surface of a log with a knife to make an Otem.</p>

  <p>The carving knife bore a Maren ritual inscription — it resonated with the magical energy in the surrounding trees, making it easy even for a child to carve.</p>

  <p><i>“Brother, brother! Please play with me, brother!”</i></p>

  <p>My little sister Giselle tugged at my sleeve.</p>

  <p>She was two years younger than me — meaning she was two now.<br>
  She looked like Mother, with large eyes and long lashes that made them stand out even more.<br>
  Her hair and skin were white, her eyes red — like every Maren.</p>

  <p>Giselle’s ethereal beauty mixed with childish innocence made her look like a porcelain doll.<br>
  When she slept, I sometimes wondered if she was one.</p>

  <p>For some reason, my parents always left her in my care.<br>
  Sure, I’m her older brother — but I’m still only four.<br>
  Sometimes I think they’re pushing a bit too much responsibility on me. Maybe that’s just my old Japanese mindset clashing with Maren culture.</p>

  <p>It’s not like our parents are too busy, nor do they seem neglectful.<br>
  Once, I even caught them smiling warmly from a distance as Giselle and I played together.<br>
  Maybe they just wanted us to grow close as siblings.</p>

  <p><i>“Brother? Are you listening, brother?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“I’m focusing on making an Otem right now. I’ll play with you when I’m done.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“…Why are you so obsessed with those Otems, brother?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“It’s not the Otems themselves — it’s what comes after them.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“After… them?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Yeah. Otems are the foundation of all magical training. I’m interested in magic.”</i></p>

  <p>Yes — this tribe could actually use magic, the very thing I had longed for in my previous life.<br>
  From what Father told me, it seemed that magic was a universally recognized phenomenon in this world.<br>
  That was the biggest reason I was sure this wasn’t Earth.</p>

  <p>When I first realized magic was real, I got so excited I ran laps around the room.<br>
  Reincarnation and real magic?<br>
  It was just like a light novel or web novel come to life!</p>

  <p>For the record, shouting <i>“Status Open!”</i> did absolutely nothing.<br>
  That was disappointing.<br>
  Mother just gave me a confused look, and I nearly cried.</p>

  <p>When Father first started talking about rituals and magic, I thought it was all superstition — but once I saw it with my own eyes, I couldn’t deny it.<br>
  He could heal small wounds, sense emotions — things that, in my old world, would’ve been dismissed as cheap tricks.</p>

  <p>I questioned him endlessly, certain there had to be a gimmick or illusion behind it, but found none.<br>
  It didn’t take long for me to conclude: magic really existed.</p>

  <p>Father seemed genuinely surprised by my skepticism.<br>
  To him, magic was just… normal.<br>
  And I guess it made sense — if you grew up in a world where it existed, it was as natural as breathing.</p>

  <p>In my past life, I’d spent years yearning for real magic — and now that it was in front of me, I doubted it at first.<br>
  I suppose that makes me a fairly rational person after all.</p>

  <p>When Father proudly said, <i>“Look, Abel! This is magic!”</i> and healed a wound before my eyes, I was stunned into silence.<br>
  I was amazed — both by the existence of magic and by how casually he treated it, like a party trick.<br>
  Giselle, meanwhile, just clapped and giggled, no different from seeing a new toy.</p>

  <p><i>“I still don’t understand why you’re so obsessed with magic, brother,”</i></p>

  <p>Giselle puffed her cheeks.<br>
  Clearly, she was sulking from being ignored.</p>

  <p>But from my point of view, how could she not be obsessed?<br>
  How could anyone not care?</p>

  <p>Magic. Real magic!<br>
  Mystical, impossible power — right here, in our world!<br>
  If that doesn’t ignite passion, what could possibly do it?</p>

  <p>Giselle took it for granted. Magic was too normal for her to appreciate.</p>

  <p>Even our parents were the same.<br>
  If only they’d look after Giselle for a bit while I focused on my studies!<br>
  You’d think Father, of all people, would be thrilled I was so dedicated to the craft.</p>

  <p>Honestly, this tribe lacked ambition.<br>
  With real magic in their grasp, they should be training every spare second!</p>

  <p><i>“Brother, brother! Yesterday, when I went outside with Mother, I saw Lady Philo with a Miawolf! I want a Miawolf too!”</i></p>

  <p>Giselle changed the topic — clearly trying to catch my attention.</p>

  <p>Philo was the great-granddaughter (or maybe just granddaughter — the language didn’t distinguish) of the Maren chieftain.<br>
  Vain, arrogant, and always picking fights — not exactly my favorite person.</p>

  <p>The Miawolf was a small wolf species — white fur, red eyes, and a temperament that mirrored the Maren: calm and obedient.<br>
  The tribe often tamed them for hunting companions.</p>

  <p><i>“Then you should ask Father.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Mmm…”</i></p>

  <p>So that was her plan — to get me to indulge her.<br>
  Sorry, but I needed to focus.</p>

  <p>Otem carving was the foundation of magical training for a reason.<br>
  It developed concentration, spatial awareness, color sense, and imagination — all essential for magic use.</p>

  <p>While some Otems were carved from stone or minerals, wood was preferred for training.<br>
  Wood conducted magical energy well and was tied to nature’s life force, helping to boost one’s own magic.<br>
  At least, that’s what one of our thick old books said — in a roundabout, pompous way.</p>

  <p>According to Father, the trees around our settlement were naturally infused with magic, further enhancing our training.<br>
  With such perfect conditions for learning, there was no excuse for slacking off.</p>

  <p>Now, how could I get Giselle to stay quiet?<br>
  Ah — I had an idea.</p>

  <p><i>“Hey, Giselle. How about I make you the model for my next Otem?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“R-Really, brother!?”</i></p>

  <p>Her eyes sparkled, and she flapped her little hands excitedly.<br>
  Too easy. Should’ve started with that.</p>

  <p><i>“Sit on that stone for me. Yes, perfect. Don’t move too much — I want to see your face clearly.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Okay! Okay!”</i></p>

  <p>In an instant, the restless little girl sat up perfectly straight on the stone, as stiff as a statue — practically holding her breath.<br>
  By the time I finished, she’d probably be exhausted.</p>

  <p>Not that it mattered — Otems only vaguely resembled humans anyway.<br>
  Still, I’d have to make it look enough like her to keep her happy.</p>

  <p>I kept glancing up at her as I carved, looking for any defining features to copy.<br>
  Each time I did, her pale cheeks turned pink and she shyly looked away.<br>
  Maybe I was staring too much.</p>

  <p>The result, as usual, was a typical Otem — thick, lumpy, and ugly, with no resemblance to Giselle whatsoever.<br>
  But since she looked delighted holding it, I decided that was good enough.</p>

  <p>As I watched her joyfully hugging the misshapen statue and thanking me over and over, I couldn’t shake a faint sense of dissatisfaction.<br>
  Still… if she was happy, that was what mattered.</p>

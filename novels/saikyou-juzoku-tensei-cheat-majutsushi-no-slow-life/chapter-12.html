  <p><b>Age Eight</b></p>

  <p>A year had passed since I became the chief’s apprentice in magic.</p>

  <p>I was now eight, and Giselle was six.</p>

  <p>At first, it had been hard to talk to the chief, but by now we’d grown quite comfortable with each other.
  You could say I’d learned how to handle the old tsundere.</p>

  <p>Philo’s mother would often smile and say, <i>“These days, he talks about you all the time,”</i> looking genuinely happy.</p>

  <p><i>“Let’s see it, Abel,”</i> said the chief. <i>“It’s been some time since our last session. Show me how much you’ve improved.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Yes, sir!”</i></p>

  <p>He’d been busy with preparations for a ritual lately, and since my skills had advanced, our lessons had become less frequent.
  Today was the first in a week that he was watching my training.</p>

  <p>As usual, Giselle had tagged along.
  She practiced a little on her own, but mostly she was just there to watch.</p>

  <p>…By the way, Philo had been kicked out by the chief himself.
  You’d think he’d treat his granddaughter more gently, but truth be told, she’d constantly butt in and get in the way, so it was a relief.</p>

  <p><i>“প্রেত光よ　আঁকা描け”</i></p>

  <p>I raised my hand and drew a magic circle in the air, borrowing the power of the spirits.
  When I finished the first, I immediately began a second.</p>

  <p><i>“Hmph. You think you can handle two at once? Don’t show me anything pathetic,”</i> the chief grumbled.
  His face was as stern as ever, but his hands fidgeted — a sure sign he was actually looking forward to it.</p>

  <p>No pressure, right?</p>

  <p>Today’s training was about controlling Otems through magic.
  To make them move, the motion itself had to be encoded into the magic circle.
  Complex movements required deep understanding — something my father, who believed memorizing existing circles was enough, could never do.</p>

  <p>Still, since only part of the circle determined movement paths, it didn’t demand too deep a grasp.
  In short, learning to manipulate Otems freely was the first step toward designing circles of my own.
  Of course, just moving Otems wasn’t enough to call oneself a Sage.</p>

  <p><i>“পুতুল人形よ　দখল踊れ”</i></p>

  <p>As I chanted, I extended my right hand toward the Otems.
  Two rays of light shot from my palm and sank into the wooden figures.
  The moment the light entered them, they began to move.</p>

  <p>One slid forward, the other back — then both started spinning rapidly.</p>

  <p><i>“Oh? You’ve added rotation along with movement?”</i> the chief murmured. <i>“You’ve studied well.”</i></p>

  <p>He sounded genuinely pleased.</p>

  <p>But I wasn’t done yet.
  I drew a third magic circle in the air.</p>

  <p><i>“বায়ু風よ　এই হাত球を象れ”</i></p>

  <p>I aimed at one of the Otems.
  The energy from my palm turned into wind, shaped into a sphere according to the circle’s pattern, and shot toward it.</p>

  <p>The spinning Otem immediately stopped and dodged the incoming wind.
  Since I’d weakened the spell, the ball dispersed harmlessly when it hit the wall.</p>

  <p>The chief suddenly stood up with a loud clatter.</p>

  <p><i>“What—! You built responsive behavior into the magic circle!?”</i></p>

  <p>The old man, who was usually unflappable, shouted in astonishment.
  Giselle, who already knew, puffed up proudly beside him.
  Cute. It made me happy that my little sister could be proud of me.</p>

  <p><i>“But how… I never taught you how to implement reaction patterns!”</i></p>

  <p><i>“I was experimenting and found a detail that caught my eye. I investigated further around that point.”</i></p>

  <p>In truth, it had taken nearly a week of sleepless nights — trying every combination, mapping when the magic worked and when it didn’t.
  The result of sheer stubbornness.</p>

  <p><i>“…Well done. Truly well done,”</i> the chief said, his voice rough. <i>“You’ve reached the level of a first-rate magician. Even without me, you could continue on your own. I never imagined you’d grow this much in a single year.”</i></p>

  <p>His voice trembled.
  When I looked, I saw tears glistening in his eyes.</p>

  <p><i>“Chief?”</i> I asked.</p>

  <p>He quickly wiped them away with his sleeve.
  <i>“I-It’s not emotion! Dust got in my eyes, that’s all!”</i></p>

  <p>…Yeah. Definitely Philo’s grandfather.</p>

  <p><i>“But still, it helps to have someone to guide me…”</i></p>

  <p><i>“From now on, I’ll allow you to borrow from the library,”</i> he said. <i>“Take whatever books you like. If I keep teaching you, I might only hinder your progress. You’ve got both talent and determination.”</i></p>

  <p>Until now, he’d warned me not to enter the archive since the books were too valuable — and now he was telling me to take them freely.
  That alone made me genuinely happy.</p>

  <p>But his tone carried a faint loneliness.
  Lately, he’d been spending more time with me than with his own granddaughter.
  The thought that today might be our last lesson made me feel a bit lonely too.</p>

  <p><i>“…Would it be alright if I came by sometimes, just for advice?”</i> I asked.</p>

  <p><i>“…If it’s only sometimes,”</i> he said, looking away. <i>“I might consider it.”</i></p>

  <p>Still as shy as ever.
  When I grinned, he turned his face aside — but I could see the smile tugging at his lips.</p>

  <p><i>“Um, may I borrow four of those Otems?”</i> I asked.</p>

  <p><i>“Hm? I don’t mind, but what for?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“I need them to carry books.”</i></p>

  <p>I picked four of the larger ones from the room.</p>

  <p><i>“প্রেত光よ　আঁকা描け”</i></p>

  <p>I chanted and drew four magic circles in the air.
  Now, how was the path to the library again?
  If I used the reactive-behavior technique, they could avoid walls — and I could give simple verbal orders too.
  If one stopped moving, I’d just redraw the circle and recast the spell.</p>

  <p><i>“পুতুল人形よ　দখল踊れ”</i></p>

  <p>The four Otems began to move.
  Each one could probably carry ten books on its back.
  Otems really were useful. My next focus would be refining control circles for them.</p>

  <p><i>“Well then, I’ll go fetch the books,”</i> I said.</p>

  <p><i>“W-wait, Abel! I said you could borrow them, but how many books do you intend to take?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Hmm, about three trips’ worth for today.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“O-over a hundred books!?”</i></p>

  <p>Maybe I’d gone too far.
  But I couldn’t help it — I wanted to reach the point where I could construct magic circles from nothing, with my own hands.
  And for that… I still didn’t have nearly enough knowledge.</p>

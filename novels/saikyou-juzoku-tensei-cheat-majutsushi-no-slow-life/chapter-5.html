  <p><b>Age Six — Part 1</b></p>

  <p>I was six; Giselle was four.</p>

  <p>I started carving Otems two years ago—when I was four. Since then, I’ve made Otems almost every single day.</p>

  <p>Storage became a problem, but I’m attached to the ones that turned out well.
  Father once tried to burn a whole batch at once, but I cried and protested until he relented and agreed to let part of the yard be an Otem storage area.</p>

  <p>For once, I was glad to be a kid.</p>

  <p>Father seems pleased that his son is so passionate about magical training, so he didn’t want to crush my enthusiasm.
  Giselle backing me up helped a lot, too. Father is weak to my little sister.</p>

  <p>That said, our yard isn’t that big.
  Plenty of houses line up a few Otems out front, but none of them have a full-on trash-heap like ours.
  We definitely stand out, and Father doesn’t seem thrilled about that.</p>

  <p>I do try to be selective—most pieces get smashed right after they’re finished—but the number keeps growing anyway.
  It used to take me over a week to make one. Now I can finish three a day.
  The yard is steadily being swallowed by Otems.</p>

  <p>At this point, there are over a hundred lined up outside.</p>

  <p>Today again, I sat on an Otem like a chair and carved another Otem.
  Giselle was beside me.</p>

  <p>I told her she could sit on one too, but she shot back,
  <i>“There's no way I could sit on something you made, brother!”</i></p>

  <p>I actually made a few specifically for sitting, so I’d have appreciated it if she used them…</p>

  <p>Still, I’m carving every day—and she’s… watching me carve, every day.
  Her pale cheeks faintly pink, she looks on happily while I work.
  Doesn’t she get bored just watching?</p>

  <p>I keep thinking I should teach her to carve, but… she’s my cute little sister, and putting a blade in her hands makes me hesitate.
  Maybe when she turns five—
  And only after discussing it with Father. If I give her a knife behind his back, he might deck me when he finds out.</p>

  <p><i>“…Abel. Abel, my son.”</i></p>

  <p>Right as I was thinking about Father, he called to me with a worried tone.
  I’d been so lost in thought I hadn’t noticed him approach.
  Startled, I almost dropped the knife, but snatched it out of the air at the last second.</p>

  <p><i>“Y-Yes, Father?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Why do you keep making Otems so obsessively?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Well… because it’s the best training for magic…”</i></p>

  <p>In this Maren settlement, being a skilled magic-user is a status symbol.
  You’d think parents would be happy their child trains day in, day out—but lately, when my parents look at me, there’s a clear hint of confusion.</p>

  <p><i>“Even so… well. I didn’t make my first Otem until I was eight. I won’t say it’s too early for you—but you could stand to be a little more childlike and just… play.”</i></p>

  <p>So that’s it. He’s worried I’m not acting like a kid.</p>

  <p>From my perspective, spending all your time on magical training is way more childish—but saying that in a world with real magic won’t get me anywhere.</p>

  <p>Besides, if you add my past life to this one, I’m comfortably over twenty.
  I can’t bring myself to run around playing with the village children.
  I’d much rather carve Otems and immerse myself in magic.</p>

  <p>If we had games or smartphones, maybe I’d think differently—but I doubt this world has anything like that.</p>

  <p><i>“For example, how about going to play in the forest outside the settlement? You can’t take Giselle yet—it’s too dangerous—so I can’t approve that…”</i></p>

  <p>The forest outside the village, huh.</p>

  <p>And what exactly am I supposed to do for fun there?
  Maybe running around is enough for a child, but mentally, that phase is long behind me.</p>

  <p>For a moment I consider telling him about my previous life—but I stop myself.
  If they found me creepy and drove me out of the village—or worse, called me demon-possessed and executed me—it’d be the end.
  Even if it didn’t go that far, I don’t want things to get awkward with my family.</p>

  <p>I love my parents and my sister now. They’re just as precious to me as my family from my previous life.</p>

  <p><i>“Well, even so—”</i><br>
  <i>“N-No! I don’t want that! If brother goes, then I—I’m going too!”</i></p>

  <p>Giselle grabbed the hem of my clothes and clutched tight.
  She’s surprisingly strong. Hey, you’ll wrinkle it.</p>

  <p><i>“M-Mm…”</i></p>

  <p>Now it was Father’s turn to be at a loss. He really is weak to her.</p>

  <p><i>“Father, Father! You always say to get along with brother—so why would you say something like that now?!”</i></p>

  <p>And there she goes—tears.</p>

  <p>Giselle is a hopeless brother’s girl who sticks to me all day, and she’s only four.
  Saying you’re going to separate us is a one-way ticket to a tantrum. That one’s on Father.</p>

  <p>I stroked her back to calm her down, then shot Father a deliberately sharp glare.</p>

  <p><i>“Th-There, there—stop crying! It’s my fault, all right? Father was wrong!”</i></p>

  <p>Good. Crisis averted.</p>

  <p>As I soothed her, I also patted her back in thanks.
  Sobbing hiccups—hic, hic—she leaned into me and wrapped her arms tightly around my waist.</p>

  <p>While Father floundered, I stuck my tongue out at him where he couldn’t see.</p>

  <p>I’ll use Giselle as my shield for a while.
  I don’t like the idea of hurting her feelings, so next time I’ll prep things in advance and catch Father in a contradiction.
  Giselle’s always by my side; she’ll make an excellent shield anytime… not that it sounds very nice when I put it that way.</p>

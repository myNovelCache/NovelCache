  <p><b>Age Eleven — Part 1</b></p>

  <p>Two more years passed.
  I was now eleven, and Giselle was nine.</p>

  <p>I had once sworn—delirious with fever from that awful cold—that I would give up magic for good.
  But, as the saying goes, once the fever fades, the vow cools with it.
  In truth, that resolve lasted maybe a day.
  Now, as always, I was back to training in magic.</p>

  <p>At this point, I had already surpassed the chief in certain areas.
  I could see the limits of what could be achieved within this settlement.</p>

  <p>I knew it now more than ever: I needed to see the outside world.
  If I stayed here, I would stagnate.</p>

  <p><i>“Abel! We’re going hunting! Come out, you shut-in!”</i></p>

  <p>Father’s voice pounded against my door.
  But it was no use.
  A sturdy barrier sealed my room; no one short of the chief could undo it from the outside.</p>

  <p>I felt bad for him, but I had decided to lock myself away for several days to finish my research.
  There was a spell—one I had dreamed of using ever since I learned that magic existed in this world.
  It was nearly eighty percent complete now.
  I was determined to finish it in one go.</p>

  <p><i>“Apologies, Father, but I’m busy. If it’s for hunting, I can lend you an Otem.”</i></p>

  <p>Yes—after much trial and error, I had finally developed a magic circle that let Otems hunt.
  It contained multiple complex reactive behaviors and could respond to simple commands like “follow” or “wait.”
  Since it merely reacted to voice cues, I could easily add more commands through the magic circle.
  By designing the arms to move at the joints, the Otem could even fire a bow.
  It was efficient, too—capable of running for about five hours on a single charge of mana.
  Accurate enough with a bow, obedient, and far more useful than a single child.</p>

  <p>When I showed it to the chief, he’d shouted, <i>“A prodigy! Abel truly is a prodigy!”</i>
  He’d even begun using the magic circle himself.
  Though it was too intricate for anyone else to manage, given its finicky mana balance.</p>

  <p><i>“Abel! That’s not the point, and you know it! How many times must I say it?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“I’m in the middle of important magical research! Please don’t disturb my concentration!
  If you keep banging on the door, I’ll be forced to activate soundproofing magic!”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Giselle misses you too!”</i></p>

  <p><i>“That’s a lie! I already told her I’d be isolating myself for three days!
  Giselle’s a patient girl!”</i></p>

  <p>I took out a small wooden wand.
  A wand increases both precision and power in spellcasting.</p>

  <p>This one was my own creation—infused with mana and engraved with a casting circuit that allows me to project magic circles into the air without chanting.
  It cuts out an entire step.</p>

  <p>When I’d first made it, I was quite proud—but the chief had said, <i>“Wands with projection circuits are common enough. Still, making one yourself is impressive.”</i>
  It stung a bit, but he was right.
  Embedding a transfer circuit—the foundation of most magic—was only natural.
  Still, the conversation had strengthened my desire to one day see the world beyond this village.</p>

  <p>Now, to add soundproofing to the barrier and completely shut myself off.</p>

  <p>I gave the wand a flick, and a magic circle appeared in the air.</p>

  <p><i>“নীরবতা沈黙を　দি……与……”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Giselle really was crying! She said it hurt not to see you for three whole days!”</i></p>

  <p>…That hit harder than I expected.
  I’d even given her an Otem modeled after my face to keep her company, but it clearly hadn’t worked.
  Maybe I should go check on her.</p>

  <p><i>“But if I leave this room, you’ll just drag me along on the hunt, won’t you?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Of course.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Then that defeats the purpose! Don’t you think it’s cruel to Giselle?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“You can play with her after we get back.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Hunting takes nearly half a day! You’re saying you want me to come out for her, yet you’ll take me away from her immediately? Isn’t that contradictory?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“The fact that you’re planning to lock yourself away for three days is what’s strange here.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Fair point.”</i></p>

  <p>I conceded—but I didn’t agree.</p>

  <p><i>“Anyway, how are you using the toilet?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“I’d rather not answer that; you’ll try to counter it. Don’t worry—it’s handled.”</i></p>

  <p>Teleportation magic lets one instantly travel to a location marked by a prepared circle.
  I’d set up such circles in both my room and the toilet, each engraved on an Otem.
  Teleportation was an advanced spell, one my father didn’t know I could use.
  Since I’d carved the circle onto an existing toilet Otem, he’d never suspect it.
  My secret was safe.</p>

  <p>Well—mostly.
  Since teleportation circles need periodic mana infusion to stay active, I had to recharge them every five hours.
  Teleportation consumes a lot of mana, but at this short range, that schedule sufficed.</p>

  <p>It was a perfect plan… except I’d underestimated Giselle’s sisterly devotion.
  I couldn’t leave her crying like that.</p>

  <p><i>“I’ll come out once you leave for the hunt.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Then I’ll wait. No hunting until you come out.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“I’m fine with that—but Mother will be angry.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Then come out before she gets angry.”</i></p>

  <p>There was no end to this back-and-forth.
  I raised my wand again and traced a circle in the air.</p>

  <p><i>“All right, I’ll come out once I finish this. Just wait a bit.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“পুতুল人形よ　দখল踊れ”</i></p>

  <p>I cast the spell on an Otem sitting on my desk, then carried it to the door.</p>

  <p><i>“Did you just chant something?”</i> Father asked.</p>

  <p><i>“少シ待っデくだサい,”</i> the Otem replied in a jerky imitation of my voice.
  Its mouth moved stiffly as it spoke.</p>

  <p>It was a talking Otem—something I’d built based on a theory I’d read in the chief’s library and modified myself.
  The voice was a little rough, but that was fine for a quick test.
  Perfecting tone and variation would take more tuning.
  Still, it should be enough to keep Father distracted at the door.</p>

  <p><i>“Father, where is Giselle right now?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Giselle? Out in the yard, I believe.”</i></p>

  <p>Mother had gone to the square for shopping, so the coast was clear—and the toilet unoccupied.</p>

  <p>I moved to the corner of my room, raised my wand, and quietly chanted with the volume lowered.</p>

  <p><i>“আম我を　বহন運べ”</i></p>

  <p>Light streamed from the wand’s tip, wrapping around my body.
  I shut my eyes against the glare—and when I opened them, I was in the toilet.</p>

  <p>Perfect.</p>

  <p>Now, to check on Giselle.
  Maybe I could even bring her into my room to keep me company.
  I hadn’t included her in the isolation plan because I thought Father would panic, but if she was crying, then this was the right call from the start.</p>

  <p><i>“Abel! Are you still not coming out!?”</i> Father’s voice echoed from upstairs.</p>

  <p><i>“少シ待っデくだサい.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“You’ve been saying that for ages!”</i></p>

  <p><i>“少シ待っデくだサい.”</i></p>

  <p>…Yeah, I’d better hurry.
  That trick wouldn’t hold up for long.</p>

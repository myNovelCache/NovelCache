  <p><b>Age Nine — Part 2</b></p>

  <p>One day, I was trembling in my bed at home.</p>

  <p>The sun was already high in the sky, but I had no intention of getting up.
  Clutching my blanket, I pressed a hand to my burning forehead.</p>

  <p>My head was hot—scalding. It felt like my brain was melting.
  For the first time in nine years, I felt that dense, unmistakable presence of death.
  My consciousness wavered and blurred.</p>

  <p><i>“Brother! Please, wake up! Brother!”</i></p>

  <p>Giselle’s voice reached my ears, but it was no good.
  Even her cute, lovely face looked hazy to me now.</p>

  <p>That morning, I’d felt sick and couldn’t eat breakfast.
  I told Mother, and she prepared warm goat’s milk for me—but right after drinking it, my stomach lurched, and I vomited.
  Then I collapsed, was carried to my bed, and that brought me to now.</p>

  <p>Come to think of it, I had been feeling off for the past few days.
  Maybe it had been warning me of this.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the mistake was joining the farming work a few days ago when I was told to help, then trying to make up for the lost time with three sleepless nights of magical research.
  No—probably all the accumulated strain finally caught up with me. Staying up three nights was nothing new.</p>

  <p>Or was it the homemade nutritional tonic?
  I shouldn’t have used that herb after all.
  I hadn’t properly removed its toxins.</p>

  <p>Or maybe… it was divine punishment for creating that three-headed rat through biological magic.
  I knew I shouldn’t have tried that spell. It was an affront to life itself—a rebellion against the gods.
  It was beyond what humans should meddle with.</p>

  <p>I’m sorry, God. I’ll never use biological magic again.
  Please, forgive me.</p>

  <p><i>“…O spirits of our Maren ancestors, forgive me…”</i></p>

  <p>I lifted my heavy arm and traced a cross in the air.</p>

  <p><i>“Brother!”</i></p>

  <p>Giselle clung to my shoulder, crying.</p>

  <p><i>“Giselle… I’m sorry. Thinking back… I never did anything brotherly for you. I was such a useless brother…”</i></p>

  <p>If I’d had a sister in my previous life, would things have been different?
  No, that wasn’t all.
  The same went for my parents.
  To me, parents who stayed home and watched over me were harder to get used to than any Maren custom.
  Even a normal baby wouldn’t understand that, but for me, not having parents had been normal.
  I wasn’t starting from zero—I was starting from a minus.
  Maybe that’s why Father and I never quite understood each other.</p>

  <p><i>“That’s not true! Don’t say such things—don’t give up!”</i></p>

  <p><i>“I know my own body. I’m going to die.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Brother! Please! Don’t say that!”</i></p>

  <p>But despite my condition, my parents were surprisingly indifferent.</p>

  <p><i>“It’s a cold. That’s why I tell you to train your body. Always overdoing it…”</i> Father said, standing up with a sigh.</p>

  <p>A cold? Impossible.</p>

  <p>With this fever, this pain—</p>

  <p><i>“Cough, cough!”</i></p>

  <p>See? Even coughing fits!</p>

  <p><i>“Father! It’s terrible! Brother is—!”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Yes, yes, a cold.”</i></p>

  <p>Is that all you can say?
  Forget a cold—I was about to become the wind!</p>

  <p><i>“This is what happens when you overexert yourself in cold weather.”</i></p>

  <p>It was just a little magical doping and three sleepless nights.
  I even kept the room heated with magic!
  There’s no way a mere cold could be this painful.</p>

  <p><i>“But Father… I have disease-warding Otems all around me. I shouldn’t have caught a cold!”</i></p>

  <p><i>“That’s the problem—you rely too much on Otems. They prevent illness, not cure it. Lock yourself up all the time, and your body weakens.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“I have ten of them set up! This isn’t illness. It must be… yes, a curse! Someone jealous of my talent—like Philo! It must be her curse!”</i></p>

  <p>Philo adored her grandfather.
  Since the chief had been spending so much time teaching me, she might have grown jealous.
  Yes, that must be it—nothing else fits.
  If I survive this, I’ll study defensive magic against curses properly.</p>

  <p><i>“So many warding Otems… perhaps you’ve simply lived unhealthily.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“I’m telling you, this is not a cold!”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Hmm. Well, in any case, rest. I’m going hunting.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“At this rate, I’ll be resting underground forever.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“The sickness-banishing spell has already been cast. You’ll feel better by sundown. We’ll have thin white soup for dinner.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Father… by sundown, I might not be here anymore…”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Let this be a lesson to take better care of yourself.”</i></p>

  <p>And with that, he left the room.</p>

  <p>How cold—was he really my father?
  His son was on death’s door, yet he looked at me like I was some brat making a fuss over a runny nose.</p>

  <p>Well… I had been a magic fanatic.
  To parents who saw magic as a ritual or a household convenience, I must have seemed strange.
  Father never said it outright, but maybe I truly scared him.</p>

  <p>Tears welled up and spilled.
  I had spent so much time mastering magic—an art barely valued in this peaceful age—that I’d lost sight of what really mattered.</p>

  <p><i>“Wh-what’s wrong, Brother!? Is it your head? Should I change the cloth?”</i></p>

  <p>No—at least Giselle still stayed beside me, holding my hand at death’s door.
  That alone probably made me fortunate.
  Without her, I’d have died lonely again in this life.</p>

  <p>She was too good for me. Too kind.</p>

  <p><i>“I’m… fine. Sorry for worrying you. It’s just… when I thought I was really going to die, I suddenly felt so lonely…”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Please don’t say you’re going to die! If you died, what would I do!?”</i></p>

  <p>I reached to pat her head, but my arm was so heavy.
  Her head, so close, felt impossibly far away.
  Ah, I really am dying this time.</p>

  <p><i>“Will you… hold my hand?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Yes! Of course!”</i></p>

  <p>Giselle took my hand—small and soft, fitting her age.
  I weakly squeezed it and brushed my thumb over her knuckles.</p>

  <p><i>“I’m sorry for always ignoring you because of magic. Giselle… I’ve always loved you…”</i></p>

  <p>I said that, and let my heavy eyelids close.</p>

  <p><i>“B-brother? Brother!! No! Nooo!!”</i></p>

  <p>Her desperate cries filled the room as my consciousness drifted away like foam.</p>

  <p>Ten hours later, I was sitting at the dining table.</p>

  <p><i>“Can you eat?”</i></p>

  <p>Father’s voice.</p>

  <p><i>“…Yes. I think so. Still a bit feverish, but I’m fine.”</i></p>

  <p>In short—it really was just a cold.</p>

  <p>Apparently, Maren are physically frail by nature.
  They rarely get sick thanks to magical protection, but once they do, even a simple cold hits hard.</p>

  <p><i>“I’m just glad you’ve recovered, Brother. I… I didn’t know what I’d do if something happened to you…”</i></p>

  <p>Oof.
  I’d made Giselle worry needlessly.
  And I was pretty sure I’d said some embarrassing things while delirious with fever.</p>

  <p><i>“Oh, by the way, Philo stopped by to check on you,”</i> Giselle said. <i>“You were asleep, so I sent her home.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Ah… I see…”</i></p>

  <p>Philo, I’m sorry.
  I might not remember much, but I probably accused you of some outrageous nonsense while half-dead.</p>

  <p>Father, Mother… I owe you apologies too.
  Forget curses—next time, I should probably focus on better illness prevention.</p>

  <p>Where… am I?</p>

  <p>My head feels hazy, but my consciousness is definitely there.</p>

  <p>I was hit by a truck — I should’ve been dead.<br>
  Maybe the human body is a lot sturdier than I gave it credit for.<br>
  Or maybe this is the blessing of one of those black-magic items I ordered online.</p>

  <p>I vaguely remember trying “Zombie Powder” or “Phoenix Fried Chicken.”</p>

  <p>By the way, the Zombie Powder was sweet — I mixed it into my coffee.<br>
  The Phoenix Fried Chicken tasted like rubber. I remember sharing that one with my senior, Yama-san.</p>

  <p>It feels like a long time has passed since the accident… or maybe not.</p>

  <p>Maybe I got off with only minor injuries.<br>
  I recall being thrown onto the sidewalk and blacking out, but I’m not sure how badly I was hurt.</p>

  <p>Still… I’m glad I’m alive.</p>

  <p>Come to think of it, that girl — Ii-chan — was crying and holding me, wasn’t she?<br>
  That means there’s still hope of convincing her to come back.<br>
  The Black Magic Research Club shall never die!</p>

  <p>With that pointless thought in mind, I open my eyes — and see an unfamiliar woman.</p>

  <p>Definitely not Japanese. Her hair and skin were pale, almost translucent, and her eyes were red.<br>
  Beautiful — fragile, almost ethereal.</p>

  <p>Her face was very close to mine. I instinctively tried to pull my head back, but my neck wouldn’t move properly.<br>
  When our eyes met, the woman smiled softly.</p>

  <p><i>“――――――――”</i></p>

  <p>What she said was in a language I had never heard before.</p>

  <p>A man appeared beside her, leaning over to look at me.<br>
  He, too, had white hair and red eyes.</p>

  <p>Uh… excuse me, where exactly am I?</p>

  <p><i>“Ah… ah… u-ah…”</i></p>

  <p>I tried gesturing and making sounds, but real words wouldn’t come out.</p>

  <p>No — it wasn’t just that.</p>

  <p>I looked down at my own hands and froze.<br>
  Tiny hands. Like those of a newborn baby.</p>

  <p>And, just like the two people in front of me, my skin was pale — almost colorless.</p>

  <p>It hit me instinctively.</p>

  <p><b>No way… I’ve been reborn, haven’t I?</b></p>

  <p>Could these two beautiful, foreign-looking people actually be my parents in this new life?<br>
  No… that can’t be possible.</p>

  <p>I looked down again — I was being cradled in the woman’s arms.</p>

  <p><i>“Ah, ahh! A-aaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!”</i></p>

  <p>I burst out crying.</p>

  <p>The woman gently rocked me in her arms, trying to soothe me.<br>
  No, that’s not what I meant!</p>

  <p>The man and woman looked down at me with soft, loving expressions.</p>

  <p>They were unmistakably the eyes of parents gazing at their own child.</p>

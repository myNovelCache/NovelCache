  <p><b>Age Nine — Part 1</b></p>

  <p>A year had passed since the chief recognized me as a first-rate magician.</p>

  <p>I was nine; Giselle was seven.</p>

  <p>Lately I’d been made to help with hunting and such, and the time I could devote to magical training had dropped sharply. I resented Father’s shallow understanding of magic.</p>

  <p>I’d tried various ways to make Otems do the hunting in my place, but it wasn’t going well. Embedding all the responsive behaviors needed for smooth hunting was hard. I could stick beside an Otem and keep recasting as it moved, but that just ate time and defeated the purpose. There were supposedly ways to give them pseudo-intelligence, but in this settlement we lacked the materials by a mile.</p>

  <p>Someday I want to leave this settlement, gain more knowledge, and try many things. Then again, the reason I’ve been able to focus so completely on training here is precisely because there’s so little entertainment. If I went to a city, my skills might deteriorate all at once.</p>

  <p>In the first place, there’s a rule that Maren are basically not to leave the settlement. Apparently our village is like a hidden ninja village, in Japanese terms.</p>

  <p>If a major incident like a war breaks out in the kingdom, envoys come from the capital, and the Maren join the fighting. We’re considered a national secret weapon. Among those in the know, we’re feared and called the “curse tribe,” a group that wields eerie magic and controls unsettling dolls.</p>

  <p>That said, the last time we were summoned was nearly a hundred years ago. Nowadays many Maren use magic only for spirit rites, ceremonies, divination, or god-inviting rituals. The chief lamented that magic was once much more vigorous, but has withered. Sometimes I wish I’d been born in a more rough-and-tumble era… though perhaps I can say that only because these are peaceful times.</p>

  <p>To be blunt, I have no intention of spending my whole life in this settlement.</p>

  <p>There are no materials here for golems or alchemy. From what I’ve read, this world contains all sorts of things. I want to try making proper chimeras and homunculi. Otems alone no longer satisfy me.</p>

  <p>Being shut off from the world might mean our magical technology lags far behind. Thinking that makes me restless. There must be places where magic could be better put to use.</p>

  <p><i>“Brother, Father says you’re to come along for the hunt…”</i></p>

  <p>I looked up from my book toward the voice. Giselle stood there wearing an apologetic expression.</p>

  <p><i>“Mm… I really don’t think I have any talent for that.”</i></p>

  <p>If they’d at least let me use magic, I’m sure I could bring in more game than anyone. But Father insists I use a bow. “It’s worth knowing, it’ll be useful,” he says. Father is stubborn.</p>

  <p>Historically, the Maren hunted with magic more often than with bows. According to the chief, up until about eighty years ago, bows were tools for the unskilled who couldn’t handle magic. Now that we’re complacent in peace, people say hunting with magic is eccentric or dangerous if it misfires.</p>

  <p>When I was little, Father and Mother were delighted by my interest in magic… but lately they seem intent on pulling me away from it. I must have long since crossed some invisible line.</p>

  <p>A lighter is convenient to have; a flamethrower is not something a household needs. It’s a bit of an exaggeration, but that’s the idea. I’m aware of it — but I have no intention of stopping now. In this life I’ve devoted myself to magical training. If you deny that, all I have left is Giselle. Not that that would be so bad, but I’m not giving up magic.</p>

  <p><i>“Got it. I’ll finish this chapter and then get ready.”</i></p>

  <p>I lowered my gaze to the book again. Giselle gave a wry smile and peered over my shoulder. Seeing the page, her mouth fell open.</p>

  <p><i>“What… script is this?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Array script. This is the only book that really explains the meanings behind magic-circle figures.”</i></p>

  <p>The book I held was among the most difficult of my magic texts. It used Array script — a specialized writing system for grimoires.</p>

  <p>Array script compresses what would normally take multiple characters into a single glyph. It’s not exactly the same, but in my old world it’d be like shorthand. Each character packs in a lot of information, so by the time you master Array script, you’ve already absorbed a great deal of magical knowledge. It exists only on the page; there’s no pronunciation.</p>

  <p>In truth, a thorough description of magic circles wouldn’t fit in just a few volumes. By loading a great deal of meaning into each character, this grimoire forces it into one. You might ask why condense it so drastically, but mastering Array script itself is training: concentration and information-organization are foundational to magic. It takes time to learn, but once fully mastered, it dramatically increases how much knowledge you can absorb from books over a lifetime.</p>

  <p>Father only knew that Array script existed, so I begged the chief to teach me. At first he tried to fob me off with a simplified version, but I pushed and got him to teach me the formal script. After a year, I can mostly read the basics. At this pace, fully mastering the advanced forms will still take five years or more — and even that is considered miraculously fast.</p>

  <p><i>“Oh, Abel, there you are. I sent Giselle to fetch you…”</i></p>

  <p>Father came out of the house. Seeing her at my side, he sighed.</p>

  <p><i>“Giselle, you’re far too soft on your brother.”</i></p>

  <p>Busted. I checked the page count and closed the book.</p>

  <p><i>“I—I’m sorry, Father. But Brother’s magic—”</i></p>

  <p>I stood and reached a hand toward Giselle, gently cutting her off.</p>

  <p><i>“My apologies. I was in the middle of an awkward place to stop.”</i></p>

  <p>Giselle knit her brows and gave me a dissatisfied look. I have my complaints about Father too, but building stamina matters. They’re raising me; I can’t spend all my time on my hobby.</p>

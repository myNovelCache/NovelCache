  <p><b>Age Six — Part 3</b></p>

  <p>Giselle and I went together to a quiet, deserted area far from the settlement.</p>

  <p>We found a good-sized tree stump and used it as a table, laying out the divination cards.</p>

  <p>I spent the whole day practicing clairvoyance, but on the first day, there were no results.
  So, I decided to keep coming here for a while.</p>

  <p>To train as long as possible, I woke up earlier than Father and came home late at night—only to get scolded every time.
  Still, for all my obsession, it was impressive that Giselle stuck with me without any real reason of her own.</p>

  <p>After two days, four days, a week… I started to feel something.
  I kept flipping the cards, carving Otems during breaks.</p>

  <p>And before I knew it, a month had passed.</p>

  <p><i>“Jester, Red King, Red Noble…”</i></p>

  <p>As I spoke, I flipped over three facedown cards.
  The first was the Jester, the second the Red King.
  But the third wasn’t the Red Noble—it was the Black Devil.</p>

  <p>Damn. Missed again. My accuracy rate was about sixty percent now.</p>

  <p>At the start, I couldn’t guess even one card right. I was improving… but something still felt incomplete.</p>

  <p><i>“You’re amazing, brother! You got two out of three again!”</i></p>

  <p>Hmm… I’d rather reach one hundred percent.</p>

  <p>This “clairvoyance training” didn’t mean I could actually see the cards’ images.
  They didn’t appear before my eyes, but when I focused, I started to sense something—like intuition.
  It felt like a step before true clairvoyance.
  A real magician, they said, could picture the exact vision in their mind.</p>

  <p><i>“What’s wrong, brother?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“I just wish I could raise my accuracy a bit more.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“B-but, Father said he misses often too!”</i></p>

  <p><i>“I want to surpass Father.”</i></p>

  <p>To be honest, I think Father’s magical skill is mediocre.
  At least in Otem carving, I’m already better. I can say that with confidence.</p>

  <p>In other words, when it comes to the very foundation of magic, Father—the adult—is already losing to me, a six-year-old.</p>

  <p>He’s my goal, sure, but only as a checkpoint on the path ahead.</p>

  <p><i>“B-brother…”</i></p>

  <p>Giselle’s mouth hung open in astonishment.</p>

  <p>Ah, I got carried away again.</p>

  <p>The Maren people value magical ability as a symbol of status, yet when it comes to actual training, most treat it halfheartedly.
  That hypocrisy always stirs my frustration.
  If Giselle tattled, things might get awkward with Father, though.</p>

  <p><i>“Don’t tell Father about this, okay?”</i></p>

  <p>I pressed my finger lightly to her lips.</p>

  <p><i>“Y-y—yes! I understand, brother!”</i></p>

  <p>Her cheeks flushed bright red as she flapped her little arms in excitement.
  Perfect. Giselle was weak to this “secret between us” routine.
  She’d never spill it now, not even by accident.</p>

  <p><i>“Well, I think that’s enough for today. Giselle, do you want to try it yourself?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Hmm… I’ll pass…”</i></p>

  <p>Not too enthusiastic, huh?
  Can’t blame her.</p>

  <p>I’d let her try before, and she hadn’t guessed a single card right.
  She’s still only four and has never carved an Otem—so that’s to be expected.</p>

  <p><i>“All right then, how about we play a little before heading back?”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Yes! Let’s! Let’s!”</i></p>

  <p>Her face lit up instantly.</p>

  <p>Yeah, dragging her along to the forest just to watch me train all day wouldn’t be fair.</p>

  <p><i>“How about some Old Maid?”</i></p>

  <p>If we had more cards, we could play games like Rich Man Poor Man or Speed, but with this deck, it was a stretch.
  No matter how I thought about it, Old Maid was the best option.
  If we had two sets, we could even use them like real playing cards… but our family only had one.</p>

  <p>We sat across the stump and began playing.</p>

  <p><i>“Right! The right one, brother! I recommend the right!”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Then I’ll take the left.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Ahhh!”</i></p>

  <p>I placed a matching pair—the Black Demi-Human and the Red Demi-Human—on the stump.
  That cleared my hand completely.</p>

  <p>After winning three games in a row, I realized something.</p>

  <p>Wait… could it be that I’m subconsciously avoiding the Jester card—the one we use as the Joker—using clairvoyance?
  Sure, Giselle’s expressions were easy to read, but even accounting for that, the odds seemed off.
  Was my intuition working on its own?</p>

  <p><i>“You’re so strong, brother…”</i></p>

  <p>Giselle rested her cheek on the stump, gazing up at me.</p>

  <p><i>“Ahaha, it’s just luck.”</i></p>

  <p>She was starting to pout.
  Maybe next time, I’ll deliberately draw the Jester to cheer her up.</p>

  <p>Still… this could count as magic training, too.
  Before drawing a card, I could predict the symbol in my head.
  It’s more fun than endlessly flipping cards, and it keeps Giselle entertained.</p>

  <p>Truly, a win-win situation.</p>

  <p>If only Father could see this as training instead of just play, he wouldn’t scold us for it.</p>

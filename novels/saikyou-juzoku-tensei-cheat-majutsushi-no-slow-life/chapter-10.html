  <p><b>Age Seven — Part 3</b></p>

  <p>The next day I went to the chief’s mansion with Giselle.</p>

  <p>I wasn’t exactly comfortable asking the chief to be my teacher. I didn’t know him well, and to be honest he made me a little uneasy.</p>

  <p>Still — as a magic teacher in this settlement, there was probably no one more suitable than the chief. His instruction would no doubt be strict, but bring it on.</p>

  <p>Just as we approached the wooden fence to enter, a voice called from behind us.</p>

  <p><i>“Oh? Isn’t that Abel, the Otem maniac? What are you doing coming to my house?”</i></p>

  <p>I turned to the speaker and found a girl my age standing there. Her sharp red eyes looked like they could cut me. Her arms were folded in front of her chest in a way that matched her confident air. Her long, voluminous hair was tied at the ends and fluttered defiantly in the breeze.</p>

  <p>She was Philo, the chief’s granddaughter.</p>

  <p>Great — I’d run into a nuisance.</p>

  <p><i>“R-retract that! Brother isn’t an Otem maniac! Thanks to Father’s persuasion, recently he doesn’t make more than two Otems a day! He even pays attention to me! Right, brother? Right?”</i> she blurted.</p>

  <p>Well, turning that around means she thought I had been an Otem maniac before. So that’s how you saw me. I’m a little hurt, honestly.</p>

  <p><i>“That is what being an Otem maniac means,”</i> Philo said coldly.</p>

  <p><i>“Relax. I didn’t come here to see you, anyway.”</i></p>

  <p><i>“Wha—!? I— I never expected that and I don’t want that! That’s not what I meant—don’t say weird things!”</i> Philo’s face flushed red as she shouted. She unfolded her arms and jabbed a finger at me. Kids are easy to tease.</p>

  <p><i>“Besides, I know you’re the sort of pervert who only gets excited about Otems! I won’t fall for any of that!”</i> she squealed.</p>

  <p>I wanted to sock her. Is that really how you think of me? Who spread that ridiculous lie?</p>

  <p><i>“I came to see my grandfather,”</i> I said.</p>

  <p><i>“Don’t call him ‘grandfather’ so casually, Otem maniac! Call him Chief!”</i> she snapped.</p>

  <p><i>“All right, I’ll call him ‘Chief’ in front of your grandfather,”</i> I said.</p>

  <p>The Maren spoke formally even to relatives; it made the air feel stifling. When you’re just two kids chatting, you’d like to be more relaxed.</p>

  <p><i>“You, don’t you dare call my grandfather ‘grandfather’! Who do you think you are! I— I’m not in the least bit intending to become your wife! I don’t like you at all!”</i> she went on.</p>

  <p><i>“That’s not what I meant! I was just mocking the way you say it!”</i> I replied, which only made things more awkward. Fine — from now on I’ll call him ‘Chief’ in front of Philo. Talking to her is exhausting.</p>

  <p><i>“I’ve come to see the Chief,”</i> I told her.</p>

  <p><i>“Hmph. Whatever. I couldn’t care less what Abel wants. Just don’t embarrass me, okay? If you’re rude, I’ll throw you out myself — got it?”</i> she said, then turned and walked ahead.</p>

  <p>I waved her off with a light shoo as I faced the mansion and started toward the entrance. For some reason I could now hear three sets of footsteps. When I looked back, Philo was trailing right behind us.</p>

  <p><i>“…Philo, this doesn’t concern you,”</i> I said.</p>

  <p><i>“I’m just going home! Don’t give me that look like I’m following you! This is my house, you know! I can go where I want!”</i> she snapped.</p>

  <p>She wasn’t a bad kid, but… well.</p>

  <p>Still, I hadn’t met the Chief much. Maybe having Philo along would make things proceed some. If she wanted to stay, fine — no need to force her off.</p>

  <p>We entered the mansion. At the genkan I ran into Philo’s mother. After exchanging brief greetings, I explained that I wanted to see the Chief.</p>

  <p><i>“Of course. The Chief should be free today. Philo, why don’t you show him the way?”</i> Philo’s mother said.</p>

  <p><i>“Me? Well… I suppose I have to. I don’t want to, but fine, I’ll show him. I don’t want to, though,”</i> Philo said dramatically.</p>

  <p><i>“Sorry to trouble you, Philo. Please take him,”</i> I said politely and bowed.</p>

  <p><i>“Hah, that throws me off,”</i> Philo muttered.</p>

  <p>I keep this polite act whenever I’m around adults — it goes over better.</p>

  <p><i>“I’m sorry about this, Abel. Philo’s not the easiest — but she’s a good girl at heart, so please be nice to her,”</i> Philo’s mother urged, then left for another room while chuckling.</p>

  <p>Philo cleared her throat and set off.</p>

  <p><i>“Hey, what are you standing there for?”</i> she snapped, and marched ahead of me down the corridor toward the Chief’s inner chambers.</p>

  <p>I remembered the Chief as a rather crotchety old man. I’d planned only to make a quick appointment and leave, but since they led me straight in, that didn’t seem necessary.</p>

  <p>After all, the Chief didn’t go hunting himself; the younger folk did. Nothing major had happened around the village lately, so he probably wasn’t that busy. And I was only seven. Maybe to them I was just like a visiting grandchild.</p>

  <p><i>“Honestly, your mother is so careless. But I’m coming along, so you should be grateful — I’m taking time out of my life to escort you. I don’t know what you’ll ask of my grandfather, but don’t do anything to embarrass me. If you’re rude, I’ll kick you out, okay?”</i> Philo rattled off, then looked straight ahead again.</p>

  <p>You’d think she was just trying to walk home. I wanted to say that, but decided not to be petty.</p>

  <p>The Chief was human after all. Having his granddaughter there might soften him a bit; it couldn’t hurt.</p>
